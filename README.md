# ExampleBot

### Idea

This is just an example of a bot showing what discord.js is capable of. There are examples of some things that can be useful in small bots like events for example.
Even though it is a simple bot, the [Pull requests](https://github.com/Snuffz/ExampleBot/pulls) are always open to improve the code.

### Self-Hosting

Because it has few files and few functions it can be hosted on a cheap host. 

#### [OVH Cloud](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/vps/cheap-vps//)

```diff
+ Cheap compared to price
+ Fast support
+ No usage limits
- It's not free
```

#### [Contabo](https://contabo.com/?show=vps)

```diff
+ Cheap compared to price
+ Fast support
+ No usage limits
- It's not free
- Asks for some more data
```

#### [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/#Compute)

```diff
+  U$50.00 free of charge.
+ Fast support 
+ No usage limits
- Need a registered credit card
```

There are many other great services, if you are interested here are some of them: [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/compute/all-pricing), [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/). Others little recommended but that also serve if you prefer is: [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/), [Glitch](https://glitch.com) and [Repl.it](https://repl.it/repls); However being frank it is more worth leaving the PC on 24-7.
